Hello there ðŸ‘‹

I am a well rounded IT professional looking to expand my knowledge base, specifically in the rhelm of programming languages. I have a passion for learning and creating real world solutions.  Mostly, i just want to be able to "create stuff". Im currently in a Full Stack Flex program at GA Tech learning to do just that.  Feel free to reach out @beattygraphics if you want to connect or share ideas.
